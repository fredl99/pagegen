<h1>This is valid html, do <strong>nothing</strong></h1>
<p>This '>' however is invalid xhtml, the greater than should be replaced</p>
<p>So should these: >, <, " and '</p>
<p> This however, will be treated as a <tag></p>
<p>look >>><<< < >></p>
<pre>
But if in a pre tag, don't boter <3
(requires pre opening and closing tags to be on seperate lines
</pre>
<pre>
The pre tag can also span
multiple
lines
look >>><<< < >>
</pre>
