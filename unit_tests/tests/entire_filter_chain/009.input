After Pagegen has generated the site, all necessary files are found in the **[site directory]/site/live** directory. To publish, this directory must be copied to the web server.

notice All links generated by Pagegen are relative and assume the site is located directly on the web root folder (i.e. **http://mysite.com/pagegen files**). If this is no good, consider adding an appropriate &#60;base&#62; tag to the **[site directory]/templates/header** file. 

For the site to work properly the web server must be configured to serve files with no extension as HTML and serve the default files if no other files are specified.

h2 Force Apache to serve files as HTML

To provide SEO((Search Engine Optimization)) friendly URLs Pagegen does not add file extensions to the files it generates, therefore it is necessary for the web server to tell the browsers what content type the file is.
  
To do this for Apache add the following to your configuration (e.g. .htaccess).

> &#60;Directory /&#62;
>   &#60;FilesMatch "^[^\.]*$"&#62;
>     ForceType text/html
>   &#60;/FilesMatch&#62;
> &#60;/Directory&#62;

The above Apache configuration tells Apache to set the HTTP **Content-Type** header to **text/html** for all files that do not contain a "." (period).


h2 Serve default file if no file specified in request

Content files for directories are named **default**, for these to be returned when the user requests a directory the server must be configured.

For Apache this means setting the **DirectoryIndex** in the appropriate configuration file (e.g. .htaccess).

> &#60;Directory /&#62;
>   DirectoryIndex default
> &#60;/Directory&#62;


h2 Custom error pages

Pagegen automatically creates default error pages that the web server can be configured to show (if, for instance, a file was not found). The templates for the error pages can be found in the **[site directory]/templates** directory. The defaults templates are:
* **error_page_400** - Bad request
* **error_page_403** - Access forbidden 
* **error_page_404** - Page not found
* **error_page_500** - Internal server error

notice If other error pages are required, put them in the template directory and prefixing the file name with **error_page_**
 
The error pages are placed in **[site directory]/site/live**. The web server must be configured to show them if an error occurs.

For Apache the following will specify which error page to show. Add the following to the appropriate configuration file (e.g. .htaccess).

> ErrorDocument 400 /error_page_400
> ErrorDocument 403 /error_page_403
> ErrorDocument 404 /error_page_404
> ErrorDocument 500 /error_page_500
