h2 HTML templates

There are two HTML template files, **[site directory]/templates/header** and **[site directory]/templates/footer**, upon generation of the site the header is added before the content, and the footer naturally after.

If the header and footer are executable their output will be used instead of the actual file contents. Executable template files have any variables set in **[site directory]/content_variables/&#42;**, the **page_title** and/or any variables set in the content page header available for use (see "Dynamic content":"/user_manual/dynamic_content" for more information).

In addition to the template files Pagegen adds a **&#60;div&#62;** tag around the page content. The tag's **id** attribute will be **frontpage_content** for the front page and for all other pages the **id** will be **content**. 


h2 CSS, Javascript and images

When generating the site all contents in the **[site directory]/include** directory are either copied(default) or symlinked to the output folder (see "Site configuration":"/user_manual/site_configuration"). Add CSS, Javascript and images (or anything else) to this directory to have them included with the generated site.
