=====
Content is stored as regular files and is organized by putting the files in directories.


h2 Content structure

warning All directories must contain a file called **default**

All content is stored in the **content directory** (@@[Pagegen directory]/[site directory]/content@@). 

To and organize content pages add new text files and directories to the **content** directory. The name of the file/directory will be the page title, so use human readable names. All directories must contain a file called **default**. 

notice Pagegen will generate nice URLs from the file and directory names. For instance the directory and file 'About us/Contact' will get the URL 'about_us/contact'.

notice The front page is **content/default**


h2 Page title and URL

When Pagegen generates pages the page title becomes the file or directory name (without the sort prefix **XXX_** if present, see below), this means the names used is important, if you want a title 'Apples are nice' the file must be called 'Apples are nice' (optionally 'XXX_Apples are nice').


h2 Sorting content in menus

Pagegen sorts the items in the menus by listing them alphabetically, to override this default sorting the files and directories can be prefixed by **XXX_** (3 digits and an underscore). The sort prefix will be striped from the title and URL

The **XXX_** prefix for all file and directory names allows content to be sorted by changing the prefix. E.g. To sort 3 items, set the prefix to 001_, 002_ and 003_.

notice A good practice is to use increments of 10 when setting the sort prefix (010_, 020_, 030_ etc.). This means an item can be added in the sequence with for instance 011_ without having to rename all items.


h2 Hiding pages from menu listing

If a directory or file is hidden (just prefix with a '.' (period), as you normally would on Linux/Unix, it will not be shown in the menus.
