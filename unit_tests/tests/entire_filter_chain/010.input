Through configuration settings it is possible to setup generation of a "sitemap.xml":"http://sitemaps.org/" file. The **sitemap.xml** will be placed in the web root folder.

h2 Site settings

The following settings must be configured to turn on sitemap generation, set these either globally in **pagegen.conf** or per site in **site.conf**.

> # This turns on sitemap generation
> create_sitemap_xml=1
>
> # This is required for the sitemap URLs to make sense
> sitemap_page_base_url=http://mysite.com
 

h2 Page settings

In addition to the site settings each content page may specify certain variables to affect its listing in the sitemap.xml. These are set in the page header.

% Variable name % Values % Description %
| omit_page_from_sitemap | 1 | If set the page will not be listed in the sitemap |
| page_modified_date | YYYY-MM-DD | Specifies the date the content page was modified, default will use the actual date of the file, this variable is useful for overriding, for instance if the content file is a script it could set the date to the date the script ran, instead of the last time the script file was modified |
| sitemap_page_change_freq | always, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or never | How often the page is likely to change |
| sitemap_page_priority | 0.0 - 1.0 | The priority of this page relative to other pages on the site. Default is 0.5 |
