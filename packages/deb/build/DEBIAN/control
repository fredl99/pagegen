Description: Static web site generator
 .
 Create web sites from flat text files and directories, the idea being that
 every page is a file.
 .
 Pagegen is designed to allow focus on writing content and easily manipulating
 it using the GNU/Linux command line. Pagegen uses Pextile for markup (a
 variation of Textile). Sites are created by making folders and adding content
 files, then generating the site.
